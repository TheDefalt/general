This directory houses the code for a user-agent string based OS fingerprinting tool.

"strings.py" contains code to create a dictionary of various UA strings and their corresponding OSes

"uafp.py" contains the code for the tool itself.

"organized.py" contains corrections and modifications made to uafp.py
This ensures that all test code stays seperate from the final script
